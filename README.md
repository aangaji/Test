# Test
This is a test repository


using:

*git config core.sparseCheckout true*\
*echo "folder 1/subfolder 1/\*/">>.git/info/sparse-checkout*\
*git pull origin master*

only checks out subfolder 1. Changes in repo are still pulled and pushed, but dont appear on local repo if outside subfolder 1. More subdirectories can be added to *.git/info/sparse-checkout.*
For example: *.gitignore* file added on *Test/* level ignoring *\*.tex* files. The *.gitignore* file doesnt appear locally, but changes to *\*.tex* files are still ignored.

Keeping a branch updated with master:\
simply merge with master. While on branch (use *git switch my_branch*) use *git merge master*.
